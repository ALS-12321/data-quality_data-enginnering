# data-quality_data-enginnering
This project aims to develop a data processing pipeline in Python to comprehensively assess the quality of six CSV data sets. Using Python libraries, a detailed analysis will be performed to identify and quantify the presence of outliers, out-of-range data, formatting errors, duplicates and null values in the data.
